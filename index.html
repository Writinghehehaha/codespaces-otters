        <li><p><strong>Did you know that mother otters will blow hot air into the fur of their young to help them stay warm? Alongside, it helps the babies stay afloat!</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>They have the thickest fur of any animal, which means that you'll definitely get some fluffy pets out of them :)</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Otters hold each others hand to keep them from drifting away from each other! How adorable is that?</strong></p></li>
      </ul>
